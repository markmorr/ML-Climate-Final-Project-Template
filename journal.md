Week 1-2: Read the following papers:

1. https://essd.copernicus.org/preprints/essd-2021-399/ provides ideas for features
2. https://journals.ametsoc.org/view/journals/bams/aop/BAMS-D-20-0243.1/BAMS-D-20-0243.1.xml --crucially provides dataset
3. https://www.pnas.org/content/117/33/19753 --good overview, background


Identified the following datasets as candidates in addition to the Central Sierra Mountains
(still deciding on whether to add datasets to my original problem setup to see if that 
improves that generalizability of my analysis):
1. https://www.weather.gov/wrh/Climate?wfo=ind
2. https://nsidc.org/data/g02158 has a dataset that I want to pull but there's some difficulty
getting it--can't just downlaod from web, need to write a python script to pull it. Currently
working on script.
3. this repository as well: https://github.com/alex-gottlieb/snow_drought --need to download the .yml file to access the data?
