Week 14.5 Update:
    
Spent a lot of time re-working the code this week to make it more sustainable/turn it from
a jumbled mess into something that it would be quicker to iterate over. As it stood, it had
gotten difficult to continue building off. Too many data sources etc. Still more work
to be done there but it feels a lot better. I improved the neighboring states feature extraction
so that it truly works--there were a lot of issues before I believe. Started working with a housing
dataset of the right resolution that I want (from Redfin). Started trying to use a GNN to better 
accommodate the different spatial relationships rather than just using something clumsy like borders,
but I still need to clarify what exactly I'm going to define the graph over.

Things left to do:
    The experiment tracker code still doesn't work how I want it to do. Meant to be used
    so that I don't waste time re-running experiments with certain feature subsets' or hyperparameters
    and so I have an automated log of everything to help build intution of what's working.
    
    Work on the extension to climate forward data so it's not so simulated/more realistic
    Try to get the GNN to work
    
    Refine the code and try to find the balance between including all features (collinearity)
    and only using one.
    
    Intergrate my results with housing data
    
    Attempt to lower the resolution down to zip code
