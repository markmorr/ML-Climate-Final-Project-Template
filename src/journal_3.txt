Notes on some changes due to a better understanding of the data.
The National Weather Service detect storms using instruments and visual observations
(people literally spotting storms and calling it in). Meaning they may not capture 
every severe storm. Additionally, events are only selected if they are rated as 
severe enough to cause loss of life/injuries/property damage/disruption to commerice.

Meaning this could also be used by commerial businesses deciding where to locate,
especially as commercial real estate is also subject to buiding insurance costs.


There's been a huge increase in the number of storms reported due to technology 
and  population increases in previously sparse areas. For that reason, I might restrict 
my analysis to areas that have had consistent density (or that didn't show a major
increase in storm prevalence, although doing it that way might be ignoring the very
thing that I want to identify--places where storms have increased dramatically in
prevalence due to climate or some other factor.) Another way of doing this would
be in comparing only the top-10 worst storms that occurred in an area, the assumption
being that the biggest storm would always be reported, regardless of which decade
it occurs in. I should check what the distribution of damage is--whether
it's heavily concentrated in the top 10 or something. Q-Q Plot?
The damage estimates are also just that--heavily guesswork--so binning will likely 
be useful. Maybe I do something like total damage?

I could also identify the top-10 hottest real estate places. and focus on those areas.

Working in the housing prices will also be a large component.


I could use a random forest baseline or something like Prophet to do the initial 
temperature-informed analysis.

Remaining quesitons to verify:
Does storm insurance exist to any degree?
The power would be in the branding--"climate insurance"
